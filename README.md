# Touchless_3D_Interface
Tracking of conducting object like hand/metal in a 3D space utilizing the concept of potential difference between electrodes.
Electrodes are placed in x,y,z axis and voltage is taken through Arduino.
Applied kalman filter to stabilize values and track the position of object along with diplaying the same in GUI using Prcessing software.
Requirements:
Arduino
Processing
Aluminium foils as Electrodes.
